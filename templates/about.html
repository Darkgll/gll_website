                <p>In <strong>2019</strong> I have graduated from the <em>Financial University under
                    the Government
                    of the Russian Federation (Barnaul Branch)</em>.
                    After graduating, I was invited to work in a new startup project for the development of an
                    educational cryptocurrency online exchange. In time, I realized, that this work will not give me a
                    good future. Due to the pandemic,
                    the project was closed. After this I decided to search for what I really want to do in my life.
                    I wanted to do something interesting, something that can be really beneficial for people, not only
                    for myself,
                    and at the end of year 2020, I have made a very important decision to learn programming.
                </p>
                <p>On <strong> December 2021</strong> I've
                    got my first programmer job in the company <em>Sovcombank Technologies</em>, as a Python developer (Specialist).
                    Before that time I knew nothing about programming. 
                    <p><strong>My current job mostly includes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Getting data from by API or from local files, parsing it and saving to database (SQL Oracle, sqlalchemy)</li>
                      <li>Automation processing of tasks in <a href="https://pyrus.com/en">"Pyrus"</a>, like: creating tasks, 
                      updating tasks, saving data from tasks to DB, writing comments and else.</li>
                      <li>Making notification bots, services for Telegram groups, email notifications.</li>
                      <li>Made various important bots, that are working with Active Directory, creating, 
                      updating and deleting Users, by getting info from tasks (by using LDAP library).</li>
                      <li>Made small service for storing cash in Redis (Using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>In free time at home learning, making myself familiar with:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>JavaScript, Node.js React (took a course at Udemy to be able to understand core of web development).</li>
                      <li>At first year of learning programming, (by learning Python) made a website on Flask with help of the course from Udemy.</li>
                      <li>Django (Learning it now, by CS50, various courses and docs)</li>
                      <li>Helping my friend who is studying at University, to learn programming (C++, C#, Java, 
                        Python. Even if I never worked with Java, for example, it is much easier for me to understand basics, 
                        so I can explain it to my friend. 
                        While looking at his tasks, I'm also learning basics of these languages by myself and getting a good practice.</li>
                      <li>Slowly learning Japanese (by Anki, YouTube, a with help of my wonderfull Japanese friend).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                  </p>
                  <h1>My dream is what I live for.</h1>
                  <p>
                    I've started my programming path to be able to find a job in Japan later. To be a valuable employee there.
                    To make something good for Japan and for the World, if it would be possible. That's wonderfull thing, that
                    without any doubts, my decision to become a programmer was the best decision in my life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And I'm still working on my dream and I will never stop.
                  </p>
